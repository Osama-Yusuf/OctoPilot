## Configuration Philosophy

The project follows a "configure once, deploy many" philosophy, where a single values file can define the deployment configuration for multiple microservices. This approach:

- Reduces configuration duplication across services
- Ensures consistency in deployment patterns
- Simplifies maintenance and updates
- Provides a standardized way to handle service-specific customizations

Each microservice can be configured through its own configuration file, inheriting common configurations while allowing for service-specific overrides when needed.


## Tekton Pipelines

This section provides an overview of Tekton pipelines included in the OctoPilot project. The pipelines are configured to build and deploy various microservices using Tekton tasks and pipelines defined in the `tekton` directory.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- Tekton installed on the cluster
- kubectl configured to access your cluster
- Tekton CLI (tkn) installed

### Running the Pipeline

To trigger a pipeline for a specific service, use the `run.sh` script with the appropriate service shorthand:

```bash
./run.sh <service_shorthand>
```

Service shorthands:
- `fs` - Frontend Service
- `vs` - Backend Service

Example:
```bash
./run.sh fs  # Triggers pipeline for Frontend Service
```

### Pipeline Components

The pipeline includes several tasks:
- Clone repository
- Build Docker images

## Quick Start Guide

### Installation

To install the OctoPilot project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Osama-Yusuf/OctoPilot.git
   cd OctoPilot
   ```

2. Install necessary dependencies and tools (e.g., Helm, Tekton CLI).

3. Deploy the Helm chart:
   ```bash
   helm install frontend -n default . -f helm-chart/values/frontend-values.yaml
   ```

### Visiting your application

Once deployed, access your application via the provided service URL. Use `kubectl` to retrieve the service URL if necessary:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

### Resources Created

The deployment creates the following resources:
- Pods
- Services
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler
- Deployment
- Route
- ServiceAccount

### Uninstalling

To uninstall the deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall frontend
```

### Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting common issues, refer to the logs of the pods and Tekton tasks:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

## Upcoming Features

### External Secrets Management Support

Support for external secrets management is planned to enhance security and flexibility in handling sensitive information. The upcoming integrations include:

- **Sealed Secrets**: Integration with Bitnami's Sealed Secrets for encrypting secrets at rest.
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Support for dynamic secrets and centralized secret management.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Native integration with AWS secret management service.
- **External Secrets Operator**: Support for managing secrets across multiple providers.

These integrations will allow you to:
- Store secrets securely in production environments.
- Manage secrets separately from application configuration.
- Follow security best practices for secret management.
